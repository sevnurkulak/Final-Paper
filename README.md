Author: Sevnur Kulak 

Abstract: 
Stress has been one of the main important health concerns over the years. It is important to identify specific stress factors in different sexes, different age groups, and in different locations so that any actions can be taken for its reduction. This paper focuses on several stress factors in Canada, looking specifically at sex, different age groups, and locations to see if there are any common stress factors within these groups. The paper will be helpful for the institutions which try to reduce the stress level of Canadians since the paper finds differences in underlying stress factors especially in different locations and age groups in Canada.
